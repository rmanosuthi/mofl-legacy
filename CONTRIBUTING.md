# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in mofl!

Due to certain high profile projects breaking frustratingly often, and in order to keep everything running smoothly, I ask a couple things from contributors:

- New functionalities must contain accompanying:
  - Tests
  - Documentation
- Please keep commits small and make sure the title reflect what it does.

*Minor functionalities aren't exempt either. Sorry.*

## Cool, where do I start?

*There's no "Code of Conduct" to follow and I'd prefer to keep it that way.*

*That being said, please Remember the Human.*
